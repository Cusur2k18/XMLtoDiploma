# XML to Diploma

## Installation

First clone the project

```bash
git clone <repo_name>
```

We use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to build this really simple app, so all you need to do for now is just install all libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

or 

```bash
yarn install
```

and then just run:

```bash
npm start
```

## TODO

- Add a way to read a xml file from the cloud to populate some parts of the state

- Generate a PDF from the client with the real data
